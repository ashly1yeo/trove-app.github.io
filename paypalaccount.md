# Connecting your PayPal account

## Why should I connect my PayPal account?

Trove partners with PayPal to help you get paid for your photos. Before you send photos, you must connect your PayPal account, which helps Trove identify you as the seller. When the AI/ML developer approves your photos, they will get redirected to PayPal with your account as the payee, so they can make payments into your PayPal account.

Trove does not store any payment/ card related information about you.

## How do I connect my PayPal account so I can get paid?

You can navigate to your profile, and click the Settings icon on the top. Within settings, you will see an option to Connect your PayPal account.

This will redirect you to PayPal where you can either log in using your existing PayPal account or create a new one. You will also provide permission for Trove to connect to your PayPal account.

Once you're done, you will be redirected back to the Trove app.

Before you send photos, Trove checks if your PayPal account is connected & verified. Please make sure to connect your PayPal account before you can send photos.

## I connected my PayPal account, but I'm seeing an error while sending photos
