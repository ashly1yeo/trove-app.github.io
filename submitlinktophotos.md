# Submitting a link to your photos in Trove

When you are ready to send photos as part of a project, click “Send Photos” from the Trove project page. This will take you to a page to send the project requester a link to a shared folder or album where you have stored the photos.

You can use any photo storage service that allows you to generate a shared link to a folder. (OneDrive, Google Photos, Dropbox etc.). Sharing a link to your folder can happen in different ways depending on the photo storage service you choose. 

Here are some guides for how to do this using some common services. Please note, that this list is not exhaustive and you may still need to determine how to share from your service of choice.
