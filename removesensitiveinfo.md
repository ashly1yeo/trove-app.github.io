# Revising photos to remove personal or sensitive information 

Thinking of submitting photos to a project in Trove? Keep in mind that your photos should not contain any personal or sensitive information. Please ensure you are removing all such information before you submit your photos:

***1.	Personal or sensitive information***

Certain photos or screenshots may contain personal or sensitive information of you or others – including but not limited to  full name, mailing address, email address, phone numbers, social media handles, SSN numbers, tax Ids, passport numbers, driver license numbers and license plates, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, and bank routing numbers.

***2.	Organizational or business confidential information***

Do not send any photos or screenshots containing any confidential organizational or business information or any information you don’t have the right to share.  For example, do not include in your photos or screenshots any confidential information related to marketing or pricing plans, employee information or names of customers.  

***3.	Removing information from photos***
Please make sure to blur out/ white out/ black out any personal, sensitive or confidential information before uploading any photo to a shared folder and sharing the link for use with a Trove project. Photos where personal, sensitive information or confidential information is visible will not be considered for the sweepstakes and will not meet the ML project requirements. 

The following third party apps/ guides can help you with the process of blacking out or blurring content in your photos.
