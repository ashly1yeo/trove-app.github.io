# Frequently asked questions about Trove

**What is Trove?**

Artificial Intelligence developers build software that can recognize the contents of photos, for eg. software that can recognize types of plants or the type of food in photos to improve productivity and automate routine tasks. This is typically done using lots of photos to train the software; by showing the software enough photos of plants or a certain type of food, the software learns to recognize what's in a photo.

Trove is a mobile app that provides photo takers with an opportunity to contribute to Artificial Intelligence projects by submitting their photos for developers to train AI software, for a chance to win a sweepstakes. Trove is rooted in fair trade with no hidden fees and helps you license photos for specific AI uses while continuing to own your photos.

**Why should I participate in Trove?**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a huge role in assisting our daily lives in many ways, with software that can help recognize the contents of our whiteboards or identify types of plants. AI software is trained using lots of photos, and sometimes these photos are hard to get. If your photos are used to train AI software, you deserve to have transparency into how these photos are used, and make sure your privacy is protected while contributing photos.

Trove provides an opportunity for photo takers to contribute to AI projects, but with transparency, fairness, and privacy. You can license your photos for use in machine learning projects while still continuing to own your photos.

When you share your photos, not only can you easily see what companies are posting the projects and how your photos will be used, but you also enter to win cool prizes along the way! [See the sweepstakes terms here](/Trove Limited Preview Sweepstakes Official Rules.pdf). 

**What types of data can be part of the marketplace?**

Trove allows people to request or contribute their own photos of inanimate objects and non-personal data for Computer Vision AI projects. Over time, we’d like to expand beyond photos to other AI domains like speech, text and other types of data. 


**How does Trove work?**

As a photo taker, you can:

1.	View a list of projects and their requirements.
2.	Understand who will use your photos and how they will be used.
3.	Provide a shared link where your photos are stored.
4.	Earn entries for the sweepstakes when your photos match requirements and are approved

As an AI developer, reach out to our team to add your project to the Trove app.

**What data does Trove store?**

Trove stores information about the projects and how photo takers and developers interact with the application. This information is used to connect the developers and photo owners, and to keep a transactional record. 

Trove also stores any profile information a user chooses to provide. Users send a link to a shared folder with the images, and AI developers and the Trove team can consume the links.

Your photos are licensed by you for use only in projects you submit them to, and without rights to resell them to anyone else.

**I’m a photo taker. How is my privacy protected?**

Through clear and transparent licensing, Trove provides both you and the AI developers insight into how your data is used. You can review the [Terms of Use here](/Trove Limited Preview Terms of Use). Your submitted photos are only shared with the Trove team at Microsoft and the requester and are not available publicly.
