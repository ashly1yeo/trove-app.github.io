# Frequently asked questions about Trove

## What is Trove?

Trove is a marketplace app that lets you earn money by sharing photos with AI projects. Trove works with AI developers to create projects looking for photos. You can view a project's details, share your photos and get paid if your photos are useful in a project.

## Why should I participate in Trove?

Trove provides an opportunity for photo takers to earn money while contributing to AI projects with transparency, fairness, and privacy. You can license your photos for use in machine learning projects while still continuing to own your photos.

When you share your photos, not only can you easily see what companies are posting the projects and how your photos will be used, but you also get paid when your photos are useful.

## What types of data can be part of the marketplace?

Trove currently supports sharing photos of inanimate objects and non-personal data for Computer Vision AI projects. Over time, we’d like to expand beyond photos to other AI domains like speech, text and other types of data. 

## How does Trove work?

As a photo taker, you can:

1.	View a list of projects and their requirements.
2.	Understand who will use your photos and how they will be used.
3.	Provide a shared link where your photos are stored.
4.	Earn entries for the sweepstakes when your photos match requirements and are approved

## What data does Trove store?

Trove stores information about the projects and your profile information required to participate in projects. When you share photos with a project, we upload the photos you share to your OneDrive account, and share them only with the developer of the project.

Your photos can only be used as described in [our terms of use](/Trove Limited Preview Terms of Use), and developers cannot resell your photos.

You can manage and delete your data in Trove at any time. Visit [Manage my data and profile](/manageprofile) to learn more.

## How is my privacy protected?

Through clear and transparent licensing, Trove provides both you and the AI developers insight into how your data is used. You can review the [Terms of Use here](/Trove Limited Preview Terms of Use). Your submitted photos are only shared with the project developer and are not available publicly.

## How do I get paid?

If your photos are approved by the developer for use in their project, you will receive payments directly from the developer to your PayPal account. You will need to connect your verified PayPal account before sharing any photos. [Learn more about connecting your PayPal account](/paypalaccount/)
