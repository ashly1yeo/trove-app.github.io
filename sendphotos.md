# Submitting photos to Trove projects

When you're ready to send photos to a project, click “Send Photos” from the Trove project page. This will let you select specific photos from your phone's camera roll/ photo gallery and submit them for a specific project.

When you select Add Photos, you will see the following:

1. If not already authorized, you will get a prompt to allow access to your camera roll/ photo gallery.
2. You can select one or more photos you want to submit.
3. The photos you select will be uploaded to your OneDrive account.


**How are these photos shared?**

After the photos are uploaded, the project specific subfolder containing your photos is shared with the project owner. They can view the photos you've submitted and choose photos that are the right fit for the project.

The project owner can only see photos in the specific subfolder and can't access any other content in your OneDrive.

**What happens if I remove the photos in OneDrive?**

You can remove the photos from OneDrive at any time. However, if you remove the photos before the project owner has had a chance to review them, they can no longer see them. Removed photos cannot be counted as part of the sweepstakes.

After the project is complete, the project owner will copy over any photos they use to their account. At that point, you can remove the photos if you wish from the Trove folder. Trove does not remove these photos automatically.

**I got a screen asking for permissions to use my files**

After our update, you may see a screen similar to the below asking to grant Trove permissions to access your files.

Please accept these permissions to allow Trove to upload photos to your OneDrive account and share with the AI/ML developer. If you don't accept these permissions, you will not be able to share your photos for a Trove project.

**Where are these photos stored?**

The app will upload the photos you select to a new folder called "Project Trove" in your Microsoft OneDrive account before submitting these photos. You can view the photos you have submitted to any Trove project by:

1. Logging in to your [OneDrive account](https://onedrive.live.com)
2. Finding the folder called *Project Trove*
3. Finding the subfolder specific to the project (the project's name will be in the title)

You can see all the photos you've submitted to the project organized by date and time they were uploaded.
