# Submitting photos to Trove projects

When you are ready to send photos as part of a project, click “Send Photos” from the Trove project page. This will take you to a page where you can select specific photos from your phone's camera roll or photo gallery and submit them for a specific project.

When you select Add Photos, you will see the following:

1. If not already authorized, you will get a prompt for access to your camera roll or photo gallery.
2. You can select one or more photos you want to submit to this project.
3. The photos you select will be uploaded to your OneDrive account.

**Where are these photos stored?**

The photos you select will be uploaded to a new folder called "Project Trove" in your Microsoft OneDrive account before they are submitted. You can view the photos you have submitted to any Trove project by:

1. Logging in to your [https://onedrive.live.com](OneDrive account)
2. Finding the folder called Project Trove
3. Finding the subfolder specific to the project (this will have the name of the project in the title)

You will be able to see all the photos you've submitted to the project organized by the date and time at which these photos were uploaded.

**How are these photos shared?**

After the photos are uploaded, the project specific subfolder containing your photos is shared with the owner of the project. They can view the photos you've submitted and choose which ones are the right fit for the project.

The project owner will only be able to see photos in the specific subfolder and will not be able to access any other content in your OneDrive.

**What happens if I remove the photos in OneDrive?**

You can remove the photos by going to OneDrive at any time. However, if you remove the photos before the AI/ML developer has had a chance to review them, these photos will no longer be visible to the AI/ML developer and cannot be counted as part of the sweepstakes.

After the project is completed, the developer will copy over any photos that are useful to their account. At that point, you can remove the photos if you wish from the Trove folder.

**I got a screen asking for permissions to use my files**

After our update, you may see a screen similar to the below asking to grant Trove permissions to access your files.

Please accept these permissions to allow Trove to upload photos to your OneDrive account and share with the AI/ML developer. If you don't accept these permissions, you will not be able to share your photos for a Trove project.
