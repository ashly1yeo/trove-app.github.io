# Creating a data collection project in Trove

With Trove, you can create AI/ML data collection projects through trusted connections between you and the people who contribute to your projects, leading to higher quality data. This document explains how to create such a project in Trove.

## What photos does Trove access?

When you install Trove, the mobile app asks for permission to access your photos. Trove builds a cache of photos on your phone (and info on whether they contain people).

Trove can only access photos on your phone. Photos (or any info about them) do not leave your phone until you explicitly send them to a project.

## What photos does Trove share?

When you click "Send photos" on any project, Trove asks you to select specific photos on your phone. 

Certain projects do not accept photos with people. You may see a warning asking to review photos you select if they contain people. However, regardless of the presence of any warning, you are solely responsible for ensuring you donâ€™t share photos that violate the requirements of the project, the [Trove Terms of Use](https://aka.ms/trovetermsofuse), or the [Trove Community Standards](../communitystandards/)

Only the photos you select are uploaded and shared with the ML developer. Trove does not share any photos or data beyond the photos you specifically select for a project.

## Where do the photos get stored?

The photos you select get uploaded to your OneDrive account. A thumbnail of the photos is then shared with the project developer for review.

After they approve and pay for photos, the developer can access a copy of your photos. The original photos still stay in your OneDrive account.

## How does Trove protect my privacy?

1. Only the photos you explicitly choose are uploaded and shared with the developer.
2. Trove removes all photo metadata (location, date, etc.) before uploading specific photos.
3. Photos stay on your phone unless you explicity share them with projects.
