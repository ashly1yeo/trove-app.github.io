# Creating a data collection project in Trove

With Trove, you can create data collection projects for your computer vision AI models through trusted connections between you and the people who contribute to your projects, leading to higher quality photos responsibly sourced through licensing and privacy frameworks. This document explains how to create such a project in Trove.

## Create Project in Trove Studio

Start your data collection project by signing into the [Trove Studio](https://trove-studio.microsoft.com/) as a buyer.  Once your account has been verified, click the "Create project" link to provide the details of your project.

## Provide Clear and Concise Description and Details

**Project Name** - keep the name of your project brief but concise ideally containing the object(s) and environment desired for example "Cigarettes on Beaches," "Clothing Stores" or "Pleasant Memories - Food."

**Description** - provide a description that is easily understood by non-technical individuals highlighting the desired content and environments to be captured in the photos you are looking for in as much detail as possible.  Make sure to call out what the types of photos will _NOT_ be accepted.  For example - "Send photos of a SPAM can in multiple places in your house (kitchen, living room, bedroom, bathroom). In each place, take at least 5 photos from different sides of the can (front, back, top, left, and right).  Do not send photos of a SPAM can on a shelf in a grocery store or photos containing people." 

**IMPORTANT** _Please note we do not currently support collection of photos containing face data._

**How Photos will be used** - provide a summary in simple terms of how these photos will be used and for what purpose.  Write it in a way as if you had to explain to a non-technical family member or friend on how this data will be used.  For example - "These photos will be used so that computers can automatically recognize cracked glass windows and vessels in images to raise safety alerts."


## Photo Requirements
List concise and clear "Do's" and "Don'ts" of the photos you are asking for.  

**EXAMPLE**

**Do’s**
- Submit photos taken with your phone camera only
- Capture the 5 sides of the object, but it is okay if you are not looking straight on to each side
- Only take images of a whole SPAM can
- Feel free to move the item or the phone to get the different angles
- Be creative with where you put item in the listed environments, i.e., on your kitchen table, kitchen counter, on the living room sofa, etc.
- Vary your distance to the camera, but don’t get too far where the can is super small or too close where the can takes up most of the image

**Don’ts**
- Don’t send blurry, far away, or very dark photos
- Don’t send photos found on Google, Flickr, Bing, or stock photos, etc. (these will be rejected)
- Don’t send photos with identifiable people (i.e., no faces), but it is okay if you hold the item and only your hand is seen
- Don’t send photos with personally identifiable information (names, phones, etc.)

## Example Photos

The sample photos you upload should be highly representative of the data you need in terms of quality and content.  Many sellers in the Trove community have indicated they found these sample photos to be extremely helpful in capturing the photos they submit.  Make sure the photos are clearly labeled as **GOOD** or **BAD** samples and where possible provide a brief caption explaining the reason why such as "GOOD: Shows doors closed, no people in photo" or "BAD: Door open, people in photo"

## Setting the Price per Photo

Most projects pay between USD0.50 to USD5.00 per photo (or equivalent currency) depending on the availability and accessibility of the items or environment and complexity of the requirements.  You can also look at other projects in the Trove mobile app ([Android](https://aka.ms/troveandroid), [iOS](https://aka.ms/troveios)) for guidance on setting the appropriate price to pay per photo for your project.
