# Creating a data collection project in Trove

With Trove, you can create data collection projects for your computer vision AI models through trusted connections between you and the people who contribute to your projects.  This can lead to higher quality photos that are responsibly sourced through licensing and privacy frameworks. This document explains how to get started in Trove and best practices for creating a project.

## Create Project in Trove Studio

Start your data collection project by signing into the [Trove Studio](https://trove-studio.microsoft.com/) as a buyer.  Once your account has been verified, select "Create project" to provide the details of your project.

## Provide Clear and Concise Description and Details

**Project name** - Keep the name of your project brief but ideally containing the object(s) and environment desired.

For example: _"Cigarettes on Beaches," "Clothing Stores"_ or _"Pleasant Memories - Food."_

**Description** - Provide a non-technical description that highlights the content and environments you'd like captured in the photos in as much detail as possible.  Make sure to call out what types of photos will _NOT_ be accepted.  

For example - _"Send photos of a SPAM can in multiple places in your house (kitchen, living room, bedroom, bathroom). In each place, take at least 5 photos from different sides of the can (front, back, top, left, and right).  Do not send photos of a SPAM can on a shelf in a grocery store or photos containing people."_ 

_**IMPORTANT**_  We don't currently support the collection of photos that contain face data.

**How photos will be used** - Provide a summary of how these photos will be used and for what purpose.  Make your summary as non-technical as possible to make sure your contributors understand how this data will be used.  

For example - _"These photos will be used so that computers can automatically recognize cracked glass windows and vessels in images to raise safety alerts."_


## Photo Requirements
List clear and concise "Do's" and "Don'ts" of the photos you are asking for.  

For example:

**Do’s**
- _Submit photos taken with your phone camera only_
- _Capture the 5 sides of the object, but it is okay if you are not looking straight on to each side_
- _Only take images of a whole SPAM can_
- _Feel free to move the item or the phone to get the different angles_
- _Be creative with where you put item in the listed environments, i.e., on your kitchen table, kitchen counter, on the living room sofa, etc._
- _Vary your distance to the camera, but don’t get too far where the can is super small or too close where the can takes up most of the image_

**Don’ts**
- _Don’t send blurry, far away, or very dark photos_
- _Don’t send photos found on Google, Flickr, Bing, or stock photos, etc. (these will be rejected)_
- _Don’t send photos with identifiable people (i.e., no faces), but it is okay if you hold the item and only your hand is seen_
- _Don’t send photos with personally identifiable information (names, phones, etc.)_

## Example Photos

The sample photos you upload should be an example of the quality and content you need from contributors.  Many people in the Trove community find these sample photos to be extremely helpful in capturing the photos they submit.  Make sure the photos are clearly labeled as **GOOD** or **BAD** samples.  When possible, also provide a brief caption explaining the reason.

For example - _"GOOD: Shows doors closed, no people in photo"_ or _"BAD: Elevator buttons only"_

## Setting the Price per Photo

Most projects pay between USD0.50 to USD5.00 per photo (or equivalent currency) depending on the availability and accessibility of the items or environment and complexity of the requirements.  We encourage you to look at other projects in the Trove mobile app ([Android](https://aka.ms/troveandroid), [iOS](https://aka.ms/troveios)) for guidance on setting the appropriate price to pay per photo for your project.
