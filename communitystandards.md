# Community Standards for Trove

With Trove, our vision is to build a new type of experimental marketplace  rooted in transparency, privacy, and fairness. By helping establish an equitable market, Trove creates a fairer ecosystem designed to benefit both Artificial Intelligence (AI) developers looking for photos and photo takers who can contribute them to projects.￼

You are a part of our community! Your commitment to these guidelines in all your Trove activities ensures a positive experience for all participants. 

## Be a Good Neighbor

Please treat all other Trove participants with respect and do not use this app to threaten, harass, stalk, or abuse other users.

We may remove content in your profile, reviews or photo submissions that advocates or encourages expressions of violence, bigotry, racism, hatred, obscenity, or profanity or that otherwise violates our Code of Conduct.

Impersonating a Microsoft employee, agent, manager, host, another user or any other person is forbidden.

Do not use Trove to spam others. Spam includes sending identical and irrelevant or unsolicited submissions to many different users or misrepresenting the source of anything you post. 

We may block your use of Trove based on violations of these guidelines.

Trove may be used to provide supplemental information regarding your own profile (provided you do not spam to provide this information); however, it is not designed to be used as a primary mechanism for providing information about you or your profile.

Please do leave **ratings & reviews** for the projects you worked on. Project requesters appreciate the feedback on whether their descriptions were clear and how they can get the best photos for their projects. Photo contributors would love to know that their photos were useful for your project, and how they could help provide better quality photos. 

## Know the Law

Trove does not permit any uses or content submissions related to illegal activities.  Do not use Trove to publish, post, distribute, or disseminate defamatory, infringing, obscene, or other unlawful material or discussion. You may not use Trove for the purpose of linking to external sites that violate these community standards.

Do not submit content or post messages that contain photos, music, software or other material protected by intellectual property laws, rights of privacy or publicity, or any other applicable law unless you own or control the rights thereto or have received all necessary consents. 

Do not post or promote any materials that could harm or disrupt another user's computer or would allow others to inappropriately access software or web sites.

## Be Responsible
You are responsible for any actions you may take based on advice or information you receive online. Use your own judgment when evaluating information provided through any communication service, and remember that the information provided could be from people at any age and experience level. 

The decision to participate in transactions facilitated by Trove￼ is your own and you should perform your own research prior to making any decisions.

Especially in these times, stay safe and follow any social distancing rules in place in your area.

## Help Protect Your Privacy and Property

We caution you against giving out any personal information (such as social security number, credit card number, name, address, telephone number, driver's license number, password, etc.) online. This information can easily be used for illegal or harmful purposes.

You are responsible for protecting your computer or phone against interference or viruses that may be encountered on the Internet or in using Trove. We recommend you install a virus protection program on your computer or phone and keep it up to date.

Trove is only available for use to those 18 years of age or older.
